# `03.2` Check for Live URL

You can check to see if your server is running by clicking on the URL (this is displayed on the command line) once Flask has started running, like the GIF below:

![Check Flask Live](../../assets/live-api.gif?raw=true)

It looks like your API is running live!

Once you open it successfully, your live API should say `Not Found` like this image:

![Not found API](../../assets/not-found.png?raw=true)

The reason the API says `Not found` right now is because we have not added any endpoints so far, meaning there is no data being fetched or sent. Now that we have our server up and running, let's start adding some endpoints!
