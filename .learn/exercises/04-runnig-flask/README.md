# `04` Demo your API!

Go ahead and check your API endpoint by adding `/todos` after the URL you got from running the Flask application, and you should see the `Hello!` message like this:

![Demo your API](../../assets/check-live.gif?raw=true)

Congratulations! Your first endpoint is now LIVE!

## Your URL will be one of two options:

If running through Codespaces or Gitpod, just add `/todos` to the end of your URL in the browser:

```txt
https://your-custom-url/todos
```

If running locally:

```txt
https://localhost:3245/todos
```
