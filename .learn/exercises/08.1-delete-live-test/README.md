# `08.1` Test your endpoint

This is what you have so far about the `DELETE /todos/<int:position>` endpoint; take some time to analyze each line:

```python
@app.route('/todos/<int:position>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_todo(position):
    print("This is the position to delete:", position)
    return 'something'
```

Use Postman, Insomnia or any other API Request Builder that you like to test your API.
